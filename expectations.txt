TEAM AWSOME


**Test file for everyone to get comfortable with git. 

For this weekend:

-play with git, and become comfortable with the interface
-work with sessions in php
-check out the Moodle API docs

Also, I'll be creating that Google chat so we don't have to use this for communication. 
I'm hoping to have the git interface figured out, as well as have everything we need for communication / file transfering up and running by the end of the weekend.
